0;0;0:00:00;0;0;I'm so fucking tired. I've slept six hours in three and a half days six hours So we went seven hours to the World Series of Poker with Helm you so you spent no no first of all I flew public took Southwest what? Yeah, cost me Yeah, cuz I got a ticket for 49 bucks. It's like so fucking incredible You sit in see a one also known as Jake Al's reserve seat that has my name on it. I was in the front row. Yeah, it's great. Like Southwest has these numbers. And what you do is-
0;0;0:00:30;0;0;You were first class on Southwest?
0;0;0:00:32;0;0;No, no, no, no, premium plus.
0;0;0:00:34;0;0;He was in the front row.
0;0;0:00:35;0;0;No, there's like these signs that like have a number that attaches to your ticket. And then you stand in that line and then you go on in this orderly way. And so I was, I had like A5 or something. So I was like the fifth person on. And then I sat in the front and I put my bag up top. Yeah, you carried your bags. Yeah. An hour later, I was in Vegas. It was so easy. Southwest is phenomenal. And then I flew back. Anyways, and after after losing as much money as I did, it felt good to fly for $49. I gotta be honest with you. Well, austerity measures have you can sleep better at night with austerity measures. And did you go to the all you can eat buffet and take
0;0;0:01:09;0;0;it to go as well? No, I've never done that. You never know.
0;0;0:01:13;0;0;Why did you fly Southwest? Why did I fly Southwest? Well, the
0;0;0:01:16;0;0;planes in Europe was not that's number one. And then two, I just
0;0;0:01:19;0;0;wanted some flexibility to get in and out depending on when I
0;0;0:01:22;0;0;busted these tournaments. So let me tell you about these tournaments. The 100K is literally like a murderer's row of like every great poker pro. So it was like 96 of us or something. I gotta be honest with you, it was so much fun. So much fun.
0;0;0:01:58;0;0;Why, how so?
0;0;0:01:59;0;0;You know, we play 40 minute levels, and you have to really get the chips moving which means that There's only so much like you know game theory optimal poker you can play and at some point You just got to gamble it up And you got to take your shots and you have to be willing to bluff and you know you have to bet for thin equity It's so much fun, and then you see some of these guys that just lose their minds Anyways, it was it was really really a lot of fun I finished in the middle of the pack, like 42nd or something. So that was brutal. But then the thing that I'm the most proud of is that I went from that and I hopped in the 3K, six-handed, right afterwards, and there was like 1,250 people in that, and I got to 81st. And the problem was I just couldn't get anything going. I couldn't get any real... You need some card distribution. You have to, at some point, make some hands. You can't just... I could bluff my way to 81st, but I needed hands to really, to really, really have a chance to chip up and run it. Then I played in the Raz, which is seven card stuff low. There's 126 people now when I finished in the middle of the pack there. And then this 10K bounty, there's about 600 people and I finished like 150.
0;0;0:03:08;0;0;Those are all respectable.
0;0;0:03:09;0;0;I mean, I know play tournaments. I have no idea how to play tournament, to be honest. I know how to play poker. I know how to play cash games, but tournaments are very different, so I feel like I was very ill-prepared, but I had so much fun. And you know, the crazy thing is, when you're playing for 12 hours a day, you are focused for 12 hours. The thing that I forgot is that you end up, I ended up losing like two and a half pounds. Oh, wow. If your brain is going, going, going, eight hours a day.
0;0;0:03:35;0;0;That's the biggest muscle in the body.
0;0;0:03:36;0;0;Biggest fucking thing, and I was, I was mentally devastated at the end of each night. You're just lying in bed eyes awake Yep, and then you can't sleep and so then you know, you go and you play craps and buck rot Break the casino for a couple hundred times a night there and then go back to bed. That's great
0;0;0:03:49;0;0;Sounds like a great week. The good news is as Phil was live blogging
0;0;0:03:53;0;0;For you on your behalf from from day over your shoulder
0;0;0:03:57;0;0;Oh, by the way, the other thing was I brought my phone, but I don't have anything on my phone. Like, I don't have Twitter, I don't have any of that stuff, so I was just totally in the zone. It felt so great to not be connected to social media.
0;0;0:04:11;0;0;It's a flow experience, it's a flow experience, when you can turn everything off and just be in the moment. Congratulations on coming in the 10% of the field and the 3,000, or 8% of the field. That's incredible, dude.
0;0;0:04:21;0;0;If I really practiced at these tournaments, I think I would bink a couple, but I just don't have the time.
0;0;0:04:25;0;0;The paradox there is that you did best in the largest field. If you can do this for three or four years, and you go into those Raz fields when it's 100, or those 25K, 100Ks when it's 100, 200 people,
0;0;0:04:37;0;0;in the 100K there's 90, 95, 96 people. Like, you really do have about a 1% shot of winning the thing, which is pretty incredible.
0;0;0:04:45;0;0;Yeah, Raz too. Raz is always 100.
0;0;0:04:47;0;0;I love tournament poker. That was my game back in the day. Well, it's because you're afraid to lose money, so it's perfect for you. Put up a small amount of money, and you can play for many hours. In your mind, you're probably dividing the number of hours by your buy-in so that you can think about what your hourly cost is. I actually like tournament poker because when you lose, you lose. Like you can't just rebuy. And then there's a broader macro strategy. You start to play the chips against the other players because you know how everyone else is playing based on how many chips they have in front of them. It's a great point. This theory of ICM, which is like independent chip model, is exactly what you just said. The craziest thing, Friedberg, happens right at the money bubble. These guys start... I've never seen this before. They ultra tank.
0;0;0:05:28;0;0;Ultra tank.
0;0;0:05:29;0;0;Oh, yeah.
0;0;0:05:30;0;0;They go in the tank for two minutes and then they fold. So obnoxious. When I used to play tournament poker, I'd sit... I'd fold ace-king suited. You'd fold pocket queens. You'd fold everything if you're on the bubble of getting into the money, or you're on the bubble of getting to the final table, it just doesn't matter, because if there's three guys with you that have smaller chip stacks, let them get blinded off, and now you're in the money, or now you're on the final table, and then you'll play poker, it's like, go get up, go have some dinner, come back in an hour, don't even look at your cards, if you can cruise your way there, it's a totally different kind of game, totally different. There's a guy that was tanking, he's a really lovely guy, British guy. I offered him the min cash just to stop tanking. I was like, please stop tanking for four minutes. I'm folding your ass. I'll just.
0;0;0:06:14;0;0;You needed his action.
0;0;0:06:15;0;0;I had a guy do this in a tournament, and I timed it with the rest of the table. I took out my phone, I timed it, and I said, whatever number of seconds you do, I'm doubling. And I just did that. It was so obnoxious that the entire table, like the guy finally stopped. Well, in the 100K we actually had a better setup, which is that we had these iPads on the table, and everybody gets a 30 second shot clock. So you can't really fuck around, but then in these big field events, they're not gonna have iPads on 100 tables, obviously. Yes. And so instead, people just tank forever, and then you have to call the floor, and you have to call time on these folks. The funniest thing, though, is like the last tournament I bought in for was a 10k secret bounty, which means that on day two, when you knock somebody out, you actually everybody stops the action, you go up on stage and you pull like out of like treasure hunting. Yeah. And some of these bounties can be like a million bucks. And obviously, there's a lot of people there that kind of recognize me. And when they saw me in the 10k secret bounty, there was like a movement. It was so funny. They were like, if you win the secret bounty, and you win the million, we're gonna revolt and burn the Paris Paris. And I thought, you know, it's true. It'd be patently unfair if I was the one that won that million dollars secret value.
0;0;0:07:30;0;0;How many selfies did you take on Southwest? That's the question everybody wants to know how many people recognize you on Southwest. And what was the shame that you felt?
0;0;0:07:38;0;0;Oh, it was great.
0;0;0:07:39;0;0;I felt great.
0;0;0:07:39;0;0;I'm gonna fly southwest to Vegas all the time now. It's fucking great. It literally was, honestly, to get from my house to the gate where you stand to get into the plane, it was like, plus or maybe 15 minutes more than just driving on the tarmac. Like, it was a nothing burger.
0;0;0:07:53;0;0;J. Cal.
0;0;0:07:54;0;0;It's amazing what a down market can do
0;0;0:07:56;0;0;to people's framing.
0;0;0:07:57;0;0;You know what this is? You know what this is?
0;0;0:07:59;0;0;What is it, Brad?
0;0;0:08:00;0;0;This is the victory of the age of fitness. Chama, Chama, Southwest. You were in the first row. I started in measures.
0;0;0:08:11;0;0;You were in the front row of Southwest. All right, listen, there's a big docket today. We've got a lot on the plate. David Sachs is busy in a star chamber right now selecting the next president of the United States. He's picking a VP in the cabinet for whoever's going to win. So he couldn't make it today, so we brought the fifth bestie, Brad Gershner, back and great timing because the Fed decided to pause rate hikes in Just yesterday, I guess and this would have been the 11th consecutive Rate hike is that about right? That's right, and they anticipated Two more 25 basis hikes before the end of the year. So here's just the Fed funds effective rate so you can all can see it here over time. And there was also some big news this week. Couple of 2023 IPO candidates started to be floated. Obviously we've been hearing about Reddit and Shripe for a while but Arm confidentially filed for an IPO back in April and they're seeking to raise between 8 and 10 billion later this year. And that would be a pretty big deal for SoftBank, which owns the firm and that could I guess save SoftBank which has had a just a brutal run with the two different. Why would this save SoftBank? The arm deal is being done, what's the valuation it's being done at? SoftBank acquired Arm for 32 billion in 2016. They don't know the valuation right now. They haven't put that out there yet. I mean they were originally looking for
0;0;0:09:35;0;0;anywhere from 30 to 70 but I mean Brad where do you think that comes out? I have no idea. I think that you know, they're shopping to get these anchor tenants into arm. If the IPO market was super hot, and this was really easy to get done, this would have been done, you know, so I think, you know, they're tiptoeing out because they need to get it into the public market. But, you know, I think that anybody who does an IPO today, okay, is going to demand a, you know, a rate of return into that offering. That is a significant margin of safety relative to all deals that were done in 20 and 21. And what that means is on the roadshow, investment banks go and they try to drum up demand. They want to have anchors in the IPO book, they call firms like ours, they call strategic investors, they want to size up what that is, and they give you their expectation of fair value or where they think the IPO will trade to. Of course, you meet with management, you ascertain and develop your own expectations of fair value. What I'm saying is maybe in the peak, in 2021, people were getting thinner and thinner in terms of the margin of safety they demand. My expectations, whether it's Arm, whether it's Databricks or other companies that are starting to queue up, and these are fantastic companies, right? Make no mistake about it. NVIDIA tried to buy Arm and, you know, Databricks is doing over a billion in revenue, growing extraordinarily fast, led by an incredible team. But in order to get into the public markets, they have to step in with a bigger discount than they would have
0;0;0:11:17;0;0;pre-correction. And just to put some numbers on it, Arm had agreed to be acquired by NVIDIA for $40 billion before the talks fell through. That was due to regulatory scrutiny. Bloomberg says Arm is aiming for a valuation of $70 billion. Obviously, there's no confirmation about that.
0;0;0:11:31;0;0;That's just the news, hopefully, intelligently speculating about it. What exactly would you be buying for $70 billion? I thought they missed it. Arm had a window where they had to make some really important product decisions to be able to actually have reference designs that actually made sense beyond just simple mobile processors and CPUs, and they don't have any of that. So they have a good cash cow business. It's probably worth $25 billion. They paid $30 some odd. $32. They could have gotten it out for $40 something, but it's a mid-20s billion dollar company. No more. And if you buy it at the 20s, you're buying a cash flow yielding asset. And the, good luck to all the players, I guess is what I would say. Clearly it's a function of SoftBank seeking liquidity, right, I mean they've had this position for,
0;0;0:12:22;0;0;how many years now?
0;0;0:12:23;0;0;Four years?
0;0;0:12:24;0;0;No more, I think this was...
0;0;0:12:26;0;0;Six maybe?
0;0;0:12:27;0;0;Six years?
0;0;0:12:28;0;0;Is that it?
0;0;0:12:29;0;0;When did they buy it? Was it 2016? I think it was longer. Yeah, 2016 they bought it.
0;0;0:12:34;0;0;So this has been... And in the fiscal year ending March, the Vision Fund alone took a $32 billion write down. Obviously, SoftBank has a big chunk of the Vision Fund, but this is not in the Vision Fund. And it's not in the Vision Fund, exactly. It's on the balance sheet. It's on the balance sheet, yeah. But it's clearly a liquidity driver for them. I don't think that this is, you know, first of all, Jason, I don't think the point about SoftBank needs saving is necessarily true.
0;0;0:12:59;0;0;It's not a company that needs saving, but they've certainly taken some hits.
0;0;0:13:03;0;0;Well, they could use a win.
0;0;0:13:04;0;0;That's my point.
0;0;0:13:05;0;0;Yeah. Yeah.
0;0;0:13:07;0;0;They could use a win. But the last two quarterly calls, you know, Masayoshi-san was pretty repentant and humble. In fact, he used that exact line, which we talked about it here. So there's a big liquidity need at some point for the business. So they can get this thing out and get liquid on it.
0;0;0:13:25;0;0;It would certainly support the balance sheet more than anything.
0;0;0:13:28;0;0;You know, the market is on a tear this year, Brad. Is there, now that everybody's buying back into tech stocks when people think there's going to be a recession and consumers have run out of money? And yeah, what's the thinking here of why so much money has gone to tech and this incredible rally? It's great to watch, but people seem to be perplexed by the rally. And then the Fed, even though they didn't do a rate hike, seem to put cold water on and say, hey, listen, don't get ahead of yourselves. We're gonna probably do rate hikes later in the year.
0;0;0:14:05;0;0;We all have short memories. You know, tech had a devastating year in 2022. So this is a bit of a reversion to the mean. Right? If you remember the chart, we you know, we showed a lot on this pod last year, at the end of starting at the end of 2021 was that we were trading at, you know, multiples that were, you know, 50 to 70% above their 10-year average. And at the trough, we were trading about 30 to 40% below the 10-year average, right? So the market corrected. It overshoots on the upside because rates went to zero. And by the end of 2022, when you had Larry Summers and others who were going out and saying, we don't know what the upper bound of inflation and rates is, that's really scary to the markets. And so you had this overshoot to the downside. We're still trading below the 10-year average for internet and software companies based upon our numbers. upon our numbers. And so when you look at the numbers, you can see that we're still trading below the 10-year
